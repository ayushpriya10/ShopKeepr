An automated requirements manager for python projects.

Ever felt that updating the requirements.txt file is a bit too tedious? or too bloated with a lot of dependencies? Same. A lot of times it happens that after uninstalling a package from your project, there are dangling dependencies still left.

ShopKeepr takes care of it all for you by maintaining a state of all packages and dependencies installed for the project you're working on, removing all unused dependencies when you uninstall a package and update the requirements.txt file automatically whenever you make a change to the state of installed packages for your projects in your virtual environment.

Installation Instructions:
```bash
pip3 install shopkeepr
```

Usage Instructions:

```bash
keepr <command> <package list>
```

Commands:

* activate - Activate virtualenv
* install - Install Packages
* uninstall - Uninstall Packages and dependencies
* update - Update an existing package
* help - Display Help information


Example:
```bash
keepr install django==2.2 pymongo==1.2
```

**Note:**
* The application currently supports 'venv' to manage the virtual environment for the project you're working on.
* The application makes use of a sqlite database named 'packages.db' under each project. You'd need to add that to your .gitignore file to avoid pushing it to your repo.


To-Do:
* [ ] Feature to manage different requirements and installed packages across git branches.
* [ ] Feature to ask user to take action about installed but unused packages.
* [ ] Feature to whitelist packages such that they don't show up as unused even if they arent imported.
* [ ] Solution for modules with different package names and aliases.
